# ü™ê Space Simulation with Gravity and Collision

This is a Python simulation using Pygame that models celestial bodies interacting via gravity. The system supports orbiting planets, gravitational attraction, simple collision handling (plastic), and visual trails for each body.

## üåå Overview

The simulation models a basic **gravitational system** with one or more celestial bodies, including a central static "star" and orbiting planets. It uses Newtonian physics to:

- Calculate gravitational forces between all pairs of objects.
- Simulate orbital motion around a central body.
- Merge bodies upon collision using momentum conservation.
- Draw trails behind moving planets to visualize their orbits.

You can configure the number, mass, and position of planets, as well as their initial velocities.
